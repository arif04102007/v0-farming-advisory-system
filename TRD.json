  "projectName": "Farming Advisory System",
  "projectDescription": "An intelligent agricultural recommendation platform designed to help small farmers in India make data-driven decisions about crop selection based on their farm conditions, budget, and experience level.",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "hackathonCategory": "Agriculture Technology",
  "targetAudience": "Small-scale farmers in India (1-5 hectares)",
  "problemStatement": "Small farmers in India face significant challenges in crop selection due to lack of access to personalized agricultural advice. They often make suboptimal decisions leading to poor yields, financial losses, and unsustainable farming practices. This system provides data-driven recommendations tailored to individual farm conditions.",
  "solution": "A web-based platform that analyzes farm-specific parameters (soil type, water availability, budget, region, experience) and recommends the most suitable crops with detailed guidance on cultivation practices, profitability projections, and farming calendars.",
  "keyFeatures": [
    "Personalized crop recommendations based on 8+ major Indian crops",
    "Multi-factor analysis: soil type, water availability, budget, region, season, experience",
    "Profitability calculations with cost-benefit analysis",
    "Risk assessment for pest management and crop complexity",
    "Automated farming calendar with month-by-month activities",
    "Multi-language support (English and Hindi)",
    "Responsive design for mobile and desktop access",
    "Real-time suitability scoring (0-100%)"
